            <p className='text-sm lg:text-base font-normal max-w-xl mt-4'>
            As a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI & ML, I&apos;m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My anticipated graduation is in 2027, and I am eager to bring my skills and knowledge to innovative projects and teams.

            <p className='text-sm lg:text-base font-normal max-w-xl mt-4'>
            In my academic journey, I am learning Java and have independently taken up Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++, backed by a Udemy certification that covers the fundamentals of C++, Object-Oriented Programming, Exception Handling, Standard Template Library (STL), and C++11 features. This has provided me with a solid foundation in programming and software development.

            <p className='text-sm lg:text-base font-normal max-w-xl mt-4'>
            Beyond my coursework, I have immersed myself in full-stack development. I have completed courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose), Node.js, and backend libraries like JWT and Zod. This comprehensive skill set enables me to develop robust and scalable web applications.
            </p>
            <p className='text-sm lg:text-base font-normal max-w-xl mt-4'>
            I am continuously learning and growing in my field, driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to excellence. I am looking forward to connecting with professionals and organizations where I can contribute, learn, and grow.
